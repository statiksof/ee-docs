Sharing with ECAS
=================


Sharing your results with your team members or a broader community researcher enhances the promotion of your research.
In ECAS, there are various ways to share and your computation results (datasets, code and Jupyter notebooks).

Sharing is achieved mainly through the following EUDAT services:

* `B2DROP <https://b2drop.eudat.eu>`_ is a DropBox-like service to store and share your data/workflows.
  A 20GB storage is allocated for each ECAS user.
* `B2SHARE <https://b2share.eudat.eu>`_ is a user-friendly, reliable and trustworthy way for researchers, scientific communities and citizen scientists to store and share small-scale research data from diverse contexts.
  Persistent identifiers are assigned to any shared data or workflow, which improve the its findability.

For more details, please consult the corresponding documentation on how to use these services.
ECAS is integrated within the software stack. There should be no extra effort to use them within your workflows.
Only mandatory step is to provide your credentials in order to access "your" private workspace.
