ECAS File System
================

There are two ways to register/log in to ECAS. The current release of ECAS allows authentication/authorization using LDAP.
For this, an account at DKRZ is required.
However, since ECAS is related to the `EOSCHUB project <https://www.eosc-hub.eu/>`_, the authentication/authorization process will be through one the EOSCHUB AAI providers (INDIGO IAM, B2ACCESS and EGI Check IN).
